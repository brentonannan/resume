# Brenton's Resume

To install:

```
gem install bundler
bundle
chmod +x compile.sh
```

To compile:

```
./compile.sh
```

This will need to be re-run whenever you make changes to either of the source files. It saves the output to:

    /tmp/resume.html
    /tmp/resume.css

You can open these files directly from your browser address bar.

[Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j4rux5r8ju17seb/Brenton_Annan.pdf?dl=0) is a copy of my previous resume... I'm sure it looked better than that when I gave it to Martin. Gives an idea of what I'm going for, style-wise, though. I'd like to keep it under one page, if possible?
